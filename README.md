# Accelerating MATLAB with GPU Computing Example Codes

Modified code examples for book *Suh, Kim: Accelerating MATLAB with GPU Computing: A Primer with Examples*.


In the official implementation ([download](https://booksite.elsevier.com/9780124080805)), codes are organized and compiled in a pipeline as below:

- include `*.h` in `.*cu` and `*.cpp` 

- run `nvcc -c *.cu` in cmd -> `*.obj`
- `mex *.cpp *.obj -lcudart -L".../lib/x64"` -> `*.mexw64`
- call the mex executable through `*.m`



However, in this repo, all CUDA codes are integrated into one `*.cu` file and can be straightforward compiled via:

(CUDA accelerated function)

```
mexcuda *.cu
```

or (C++ implemented function)

```
mex *.cpp
```
